This repository contains the Bachelor Thesis "Evaluating the Impact of Bicycle Bridges on the X-Minute City concept in Copenhagen, Denmark" written by Jule Friedrich (March 2024), the data contained and QGIS models created to accelarate proccesses that are part of the methodology. 

## Data

### Data sets
#### Input Data
- Amenity Point Layers used to create isochrones, point layer _buildings_
- bridge polygons layer
- boundaries of the Copenhagen Municipality and the
- area of interest
- bounding box
#### Findingss
-    (___Isochrone layers created for each amenity point layer for the thresholds 3,5,10 and 15 Minutes__)
- amenity based impact zone layers that contain the counted _building_ points
- the individual category grid layers
- the final grid layers that display spatial distrbution of initial, topical, and increased accesibility

### Data Description
W - topical access ("With bridges")

N - initial access (" No Bridges")

D - impact on access ("Difference that Bridges made")
