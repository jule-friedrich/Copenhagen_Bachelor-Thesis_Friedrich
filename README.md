# Evaluating the Impact of Bicycle Bridges on the X-Minute City concept in Copenhagen, Denmark

This repository contains the Data and PDF of the Bachelor Thesis "Evaluating the Impact of Bicycle Bridges on the X-Minute City concept in Copenhagen, Denmark" written by Jule Friedrich (submitted March 2024)ta

### Data sets
The Datasets consist of the Input data, the Output data as well as the models used to accelerate computing processes.

The name codification is displayed in [_]

#### Input Data
- Amenity Point Layers used to create isochrones, point layer _buildings_
- bridge polygons layer
- boundaries of the Copenhagen Municipality and the
- area of interest
- bounding box
- Grid that consists of the Residential Cells within the Area of Interest
  
#### Findingss
-    (___Isochrone layers created for each amenity point layer for the thresholds 3,5,10 and 15 Minutes__)
-  amenity based impact zone layers that contain the counted _building_ points [Counted_amenity_threshold]
- amenity based initial accesbility that contains the counted _building_ points 
- (____the individual category grid layers___)
- the final grid layers that display spatial distrbution of initial, topical, and increased accesibility. In these the individual category Grid Layers are contained. [Grid_Initial/Topical/Impact_Threshold]

### Data Description
W - topical access ("With bridges")

N - initial access (" No Bridges")

D - impact on access ("Difference that Bridges made")

3/ 5/ 10/ 15 -type of Threshold
